default.js
default.js

The default.js file is used to render a fallback within Parallel Routes when Next.js cannot recover a slot's active state after a full-page load.

During soft navigation, Next.js keeps track of the active state (subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a default.js file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.

Consider the following folder structure. The @team slot has a settings page, but @analytics does not.

When navigating to /settings, the @team slot will render the settings page while maintaining the currently active page for the @analytics slot.

On refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, a 404 is rendered instead.

Additionally, since children is an implicit slot, you also need to create a default.js file to render a fallback for children when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.

Reference
params (optional)

A promise that resolves to an object containing the dynamic route parameters from the root segment down to the slot's subpages. For example:

app/[artist]/@sidebar/default.js
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
export default async function Default({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ artist: string }>
}) {
  const artist = (await params).artist
}
Example	URL	params
app/[artist]/@sidebar/default.js	/zack	Promise<{ artist: 'zack' }>
app/[artist]/[album]/@sidebar/default.js	/zack/next	Promise<{ artist: 'zack', album: 'next' }>
Since the params prop is a promise. You must use async/await or React's use
 function to access the values.
In version 14 and earlier, params was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatability, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.

Parallel Routes
Simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. A pattern for highly dynamic applications.
