Introduction
Pages Router
Building Your Application
Building Your Application

Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications. The guides in Building Your Application explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.

The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the Routing, Rendering, Data Fetching and Styling sections, as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started. Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as Optimizing and Configuring. Finally, once you're ready, checkout the Deploying and Upgrading sections.

Routing
Learn the fundamentals of routing for front-end applications with the Pages Router.
Rendering
Learn the fundamentals of rendering in React and Next.js.
Data Fetching
Next.js allows you to fetch data in multiple ways, with pre-rendering, server-side rendering or static-site generation, and incremental static regeneration. Learn how to manage your application data in Next.js.
Styling
Learn the different ways you can style your Next.js application.
Optimizing
Optimize your Next.js application for best performance and user experience.
Configuring
Learn how to configure your Next.js application.
Testing
Learn how to set up Next.js with three commonly used testing tools — Cypress, Playwright, Vitest, and Jest.
Authentication
Learn how to implement authentication in Next.js, covering best practices, securing routes, authorization techniques, and session management.
Deploying
Learn how to deploy your Next.js app to production, either managed or self-hosted.
Upgrading
Learn how to upgrade to the latest versions of Next.js.
