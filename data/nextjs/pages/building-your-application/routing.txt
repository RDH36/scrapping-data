Pages Router
Building Your Application
Routing
Routing

The Pages Router has a file-system based router built on concepts of pages. When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route. Learn more about routing in the Pages Router:

Pages and Layouts
Create your first page and shared layout with the Pages Router.
Dynamic Routes
Dynamic Routes are pages that allow you to add custom params to your URLs. Start creating Dynamic Routes and learn more here.
Linking and Navigating
Learn how navigation works in Next.js, and how to use the Link Component and `useRouter` hook.
Redirecting
Learn the different ways to handle redirects in Next.js.
Custom App
Control page initialization and add a layout that persists for all pages by overriding the default App component used by Next.js.
Custom Document
Extend the default document markup added by Next.js.
API Routes
Next.js supports API Routes, which allow you to build your API without leaving your Next.js app. Learn how it works here.
Custom Errors
Override and extend the built-in Error page to handle custom errors.
Internationalization
Next.js has built-in support for internationalized routing and language detection. Learn more here.
Middleware
Learn how to use Middleware to run code before a request is completed.
